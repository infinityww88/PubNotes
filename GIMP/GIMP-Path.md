# Path

- Paths are curves
- Stroke path: apply a specific style to the path (color, width, pattern... )
- purposes:
  - convert a closed path to a selection.
  - to be stroked, any path, open or closed

## Path Creation

- Start by drawing the outline for your path; the outline can be modified later
- Click on image to add point and draw straight line
- drag straight line to convert it to curve, and curve control point emerge
- To add new point, the end of curve must be selected, and a '+' symbol appear beside cursor, otherwise just create new point that doesn't connect to the current curve, which start a new curve
- Black squares are anchor points, the open circle indicates the selected anchor, and the two open squares are the handles associated with the selected anchor.

## Path Properties

- like layers and channels, path are components of an image.
- When an image is saved in GIMP's native XCF file format, any paths it has are saved with it.
