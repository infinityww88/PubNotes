# Animator Controllers

- Animancer does not require the use of AnimatorController assets
- Animancer does support AnimatorController via the ControllerState class and its children
- ControllerState
  - a type of AnimancerState
  - Clip property == nul
  - Since they don't have a specific duration or time of their own, they don't actually have an OnEnd callback and will ignore any they are given
  - Setup in Inspector using Controller Serializables or created manually in script
  - access AnimatorController via ControllerState.Playable
    - ControllerState.Playable.Play("Idle")
    - ControllerState.Playable.CrossFade("Walk", 0.3f)
    - ControllerState.Playable.SetFloat("MoveSpeed", 0.5f)
    - ControllerState.Playable.SetTrigger("Attack")
- Setup using ControllerState.Serializable
  - serailizable.State.Playable
  - state will only be created the first time the serializable is passed into the AnimancerComponent.Transition, so you will get a NullReferenceException if you attempt to use it before that
- Setup by manual Creation
  - Create a new ControllerState
    - All constructors require a RuntimeAnimatorController
  - Store a reference to that state in a field and/or set its Key to register it in the internal Dictionary
  - Play that state either by passing it into the AnimancerComponent.Play or CrossFade method using state reference or its key
- Parameter Controller States
